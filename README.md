This is te first implementation of athe Smart Contratct on solidity and Js tests we did on them. The smart contract here is quite as complete as it is asked from us to do. 


To test by yourselves, 

     - Fork the project and pull it on a local repo. 
     - Make sure ganache is running on local. 

     - Truffle compile to compile the contracts 
     - truffle test test/Test_contribution_project_bounty.js


    The tests will all pass and you can see the magic  of eth transferring on the balance of the accounts on ganache. A quick video demo of that at this link :   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz_s8j_RJ4w.
